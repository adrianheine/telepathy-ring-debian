The following environment variables are used:

- RING_PERSIST - if set, keep running even if no connection is active
- RING_REALTIME - if set, try to use realtime priority
- RING_MEMLOCK - if set, use mmlockall()
- RING_LOGFILE - redirect debugging output (stdout/stderr) to named file
- RING_DEBUG - if set, determine what kind of debugging output to print
  - all - everything
  - connection - connection-related
  - media - call and media-related
  - text - SMS-related
- MODEM_DEBUG - determine what kind of debugging output to print from modem libraries
  - all - print everything
  - call - print call-related messages
  - sms  - print sms-related messages
  - sim  - print sim-related messages
  - dbus - print dbus-related messages
- SMS_DEBUG - determine what kind of debugging output to print from sms-glib

RUNNING WITH ELEVATED PRIORITY
==============================

Telepathy-Ring can be launched with RING_REALTIME and RING_MEMLOCK
environment variables set. If they are not set, the priorities are read from
/var/lib/telepathy-ring/realtime and /var/lib/telepathy-ring/memlock
instead.

Telepathy can be launched with, e.g., following shell script (run with root
privileges after the user login session D-Bus has been launched):

--8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<--
#! /bin/sh

# obtain session bus address for Ring
. /tmp/session_bus_address.user

test -x /usr/bin/waitdbus &&
/usr/bin/waitdbus session

export RING_REALTIME=10
export RING_MEMLOCK=1

# Uncomment to obtain debug output
# RING_DEBUG=all
# CALL_DEBUG=all
# SMS_DEBUG=all
# MODEM_DEBUG=all

# Make ring wait for
export RING_PERSIST=1

exec /usr/lib/telepathy/telepathy-ring
--8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<--
